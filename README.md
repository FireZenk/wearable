Android wearable Examples
========

eclipse/ is old examples in the eclipse format for wear v1.0.0 

All examples are for wear v5+

<b>WearNotiDemo</b> example of how to send notifications to the wearable device

<b>myWatchFace</b> several examples of watch faces for the wear device.

<b>TapEventsDemo</b> a simple watchface to demo the tapevents added in wear1.3.0

<b>WearApp</b> is an app to run the watch, that has a button to show a random number.
   This has been updated to work purely with studio.  WearAppDemo which also uses Eclipse has been moved to the Eclipse directory.

<b>WearableDataLayer</b> is an example of how send messages back and forth between the wear app and a phone app using the data layer in google-playservices.  You will need to install the wear app on to the wear device.  Install the mobile app on the phone/tablet device that is connected to the wear device. This works best using Studio 1.1.0+.  This was tested on a 5.1 wear device and android 5.1 device.

<b>WearAppVoice</b> is a simple app to show how the voice recognizer works. Click the button to start the demo.   The App-provided Voice actions fails, since google has so badly documented it.   "Start Voice App" should work, but instead use "Open Voice App", after the ok google command.  http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/voice.html
