<b>WearableDataLayer</b> is an example of how send messages back and forth between the wear app and a phone app using the data layer in google-playservices.  You will need to install the wear app on to the wear device.  Install the mobile app on the phone/tablet device that is connected to the wear device.  Tested in wear 1.3.0 and wear 2.0.0 as well.

<b>WearAppVoice</b> is a simple app to show how the voice recognizer works. Click the button to start the demo.   The App-provided Voice actions fails, since google has so badly documented it.   "Start Voice App" should work, but instead use "Open Voice App", after the ok google command.  http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/voice.html
